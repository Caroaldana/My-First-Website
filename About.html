<h1> About Nena </h1>
	<p3 style="text-align:center;"> This is Nena; she was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Nena short for Magdalena named after Magdalena Frida Kahlo. Why you ask? Isnâ€™t it obvious, their bushy eyebrows of course! Nena is a Mini Schnauzer. Nena and I enjoy long walks, and she specially enjoys stopping at every fire hydrant in slight, and her favorite past time is cuddling and hanging at the dog park.  Nena has done a bit of traveling. </p3>

<p><b>A<i> couple of places Nena has traveled to:</i></b>
	
	<br>Virginia, Colorado, Las Vegas, and St. Louis.</p>
